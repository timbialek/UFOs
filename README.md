## Summary

Drawback:

 One of the drawbacks the site design is that it is case sensitive and everything needs to be in lower case. A change to the coding that would convert any uppercase letter to lower case which would make for a better user experience. 

Enhancements:

 The first enhancement I would recommend is to make the filters also serve as a drop down list that would display the values available in the field.  The second enhancement would be a clear filters button to make it easier to reset the page.
